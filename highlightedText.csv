[Permanent magnetisation may also result from transient short circuit current flowing
through the line to which the CT is connected. Such transient currents

Thus, for reliable operation of the CT, the residual magnetism must be removed and
the CT be restored back to its original condition ia

The voltage supply to the primary is then gradually

The variable resistance is then gradually and

uniformly reduced down to zero

reduced to zero
